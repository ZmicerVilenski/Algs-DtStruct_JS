## Algorithms:

1. **bfs.js** - (Breadth-first search) searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property.
2. **binary_search.js** - (Half-interval search) search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
3. **bubble_sort.js** - simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
4. **cach.js** - optimizing instructions, that can utilize in order to manage a cache of stored information.
5. **dijkstra.js** - algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
6. **linear_search.js** - (Sequential search) sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
7. **quick_sort.js** - (Divide-and-conquer) selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
8. **recursion.js** - method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
9. **selection_sort.js** - in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

## Data structures:

1. **binary_tree.js** - tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
2. **linked_list.js** - linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
3. **matrix.js** - composed of numbers in two dimensions: rows and columns.
4. **tree_algs.js** - data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
